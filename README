This is an implementation of ORDPATH encoding. ORDPATH was invented by
Microsoft and was used in SQL server for compact storage of XML node
labels. See article [http://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/ordpath.pdf] for
details.

The implementation was thoroughly coded to exhibit the top performance.
Implementation is portable. Portions of the code were specifically
writen to take advantage of SSE2 instruction set. SSE2 code is enabled
at configuration time (ORDPATH_SSE2_BITBUF, ORDPATH_SSE2_SEARCHTREE
configuration variables). By default portable standard-conformant code
is used instead of SSE2-powered one.

Currently GCC is the only compiler supported. Support for CL (the
Microsoft compiler) is planned. We provide CMake project for building
the library and running tests. (CMake is a cross-platform Makefile
generator similar to GNU autotools).

The library was writen by Nick Zavaritsky (mejedi@gmail.com) and is
licensed under Apache License v2.0.
